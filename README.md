Hi, I'm Brett Loy, a recent UC Davis graduate with a passion for transforming complex data into actionable insights. With hands-on experience in Python, SQL, R, Tableau, and Microsoft Excel I've built interactive dashboards, predictive models, and statistical analyses across projects ranging from Airbnb pricing trends to heart disease risk factors. My background also includes entrepreneurship and financial leadership, where I've applied data-driven thinking to real-world challenges. This portfolio showcases my technical skills, analytical mindset, and commitment to creating meaningful, data-backed solutions.
